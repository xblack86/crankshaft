### Hardware ###
# The hardware pins can be completly disabled with the global flag.

# Global Flag (enables / disables gpio usage excluding device connected
# trigger gpio and ignition based shutdown!)
ENABLE_GPIO=0

# Possible used gpio's by hifiberry dac's depending on model:
# For more info visit the hifiberry homepage! To prevent from bugs don't use them!
#
# GPIO 4,5,6,16,18,19,20,21,27,28,29,30,31

# Generally used GPIO's
# Used for HAT modules - Never use it!
# GPIO 27,28

# GPIO Setup
DEV_PIN=0
INVERT_PIN=0
X11_PIN=0

# Device connected gpio (device connected 1 / else 0)
# Note: this gpio depends NOT on ENABLE_GPIO!!!
# To disable set to 0
ANDROID_PIN=0

# GPIO Trigger for Rearcam
# GPIO wich triggers enabling Rearcam Mode of RPICam
# To disable set to 0
REARCAM_PIN=0

# GPIO Trigger for Day/Night
# GPIO wich triggers Day (open gpio)/Night (closed to gnd) of GUI
# To disable set to 0
# If enabled it overrides lightsensor!

### Debugging ###
# Start Crankshaft in debug mode to get network, shell and ssh access
# System will do a normal start in ro mode

### OpenAuto ###
# Start OpenAuto in X11 or EGL
# By default, EGL, but if you can't get it to work, do X11

# Custom brightness control
# Note: this command is called after every brightness change - can slow down for example the brightness
# slider depending on execution speed - the process is called with "&" so call is not waiting for exit!
# Sample call which will be executed on request: "CUSTOM_BRIGHTNESS_COMMAND brightnessvalue &"
#
# Note: To allow backup and restore your command must be located on /boot/crankshaft/custom/
# otherwise it will not be transfered during updates!
